description: Initialize markdown files for Pokemon Battle Simulator documentation (team reports, battle analysis, or strategy guides)
---

Create a new markdown file with a professional template. Ask the user what type of document they want to create:

1. **Team Report** - Document a Pokemon team with full details (Pokemon, moves, EVs, IVs, items, strategy)
2. **Battle Analysis** - Analyze a battle simulation with results, key moments, and insights
3. **Strategy Guide** - Create a guide for specific Pokemon, teams, or battle strategies
4. **Quick Notes** - Simple markdown file for general notes

After the user selects the type, create the appropriate markdown template with:
- Clear heading structure
- Relevant sections for the document type
- Placeholder content that guides the user
- Tables for stats/data where appropriate
- Professional formatting

Place the file in a sensible location (ask user for filename and location preference).
